# Python Data Analysis Projects

Welcome to the **Python Data Analysis Projects** repository! This repository is a collection of Python scripts and notebooks focused on data analysis, covering data cleaning, transformation, exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualization, and basic statistical analysis.

## About

In this repository, youâ€™ll find projects designed to demonstrate various aspects of data analysis, including:
- Data Cleaning: Handling missing values, standardizing data, and data preprocessing
- Data Transformation: Applying transformations to prepare data for analysis
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Using statistical techniques to uncover data insights
- Data Visualization: Creating visual representations with Matplotlib and Seaborn

## Key Libraries Used
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and handling
- **NumPy**: Efficient numerical operations
- **Matplotlib** & **Seaborn**: Data visualization tools

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Sadam-Barkat/Python_For_DataAnalysis.git
    ```
2. Install the required libraries (if not already installed):
    ```bash
    pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
    ```

3. Navigate through the projects and run the code examples in Jupyter notebooks or as Python scripts.
