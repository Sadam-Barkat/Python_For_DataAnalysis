# Data Visualization with Matplotlib and Seaborn

This section covers data visualization techniques using Matplotlib and Seaborn, two powerful libraries for creating informative graphs and plots.

## Key Features

- **Matplotlib**: A versatile library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python.
- **Seaborn**: A statistical data visualization library built on top of Matplotlib that provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive graphs.

## Matplotlib Basics

Matplotlib allows you to create a variety of plots such as line graphs, scatter plots, and bar charts.

### Example: Basic Line Plot

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Sample data
x = [1, 2, 3, 4]
y = [10, 20, 25, 30]

# Creating a line plot
plt.plot(x, y)
plt.title('Basic Line Plot')
plt.xlabel('X-axis')
plt.ylabel('Y-axis')
plt.show()
