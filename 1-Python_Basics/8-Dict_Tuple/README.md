# Dictionaries and Tuples in Python

## Overview

This document covers two important data structures in Python: **Dictionaries** and **Tuples**.

### Dictionaries

A **dictionary** is an unordered collection of key-value pairs. Each key is unique and is used to access its corresponding value.

#### Syntax

```python
my_dict = {
    "key1": "value1",
    "key2": "value2"
}
my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)
