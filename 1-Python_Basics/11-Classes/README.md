# Python Classes

## Overview

This document provides an overview of **classes** in Python, which are a fundamental part of object-oriented programming (OOP).

### What are Classes?

A class is a blueprint for creating objects (instances). It encapsulates data for the object and defines behaviors (methods) that can operate on that data.

### Defining a Class

You can define a class using the `class` keyword:

```python
class MyClass:
    # Class attributes and methods go here
    pass
my_object = MyClass()
git clone https://github.com/Sadam-Barkat/11-Classes.git
