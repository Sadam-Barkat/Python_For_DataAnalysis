# For Loops in Python

## Overview

The **for loop** in Python is used to iterate over a sequence (like a list, tuple, dictionary, set, or string) or any other iterable object. It allows you to execute a block of code repeatedly for each item in the sequence.

## Syntax

```python
for variable in iterable:
    # code to execute for each item
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]

for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)
