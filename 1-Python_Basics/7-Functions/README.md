# Functions in Python

## Overview

A **function** in Python is a block of reusable code that performs a specific task. Functions help break the program into smaller and modular chunks, making it easier to manage and debug.

## Syntax

```python
def function_name(parameters):
    # code to execute
    return result
def greet(name):
    return f"Hello, {name}!"

# Calling the function
print(greet("Sadam"))
