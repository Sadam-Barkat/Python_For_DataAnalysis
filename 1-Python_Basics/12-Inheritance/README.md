# Python Inheritance

## Overview

This document provides an overview of **inheritance** in Python, a key feature of object-oriented programming (OOP) that allows a class to inherit attributes and methods from another class.

### What is Inheritance?

Inheritance is a mechanism in which a new class (child or subclass) derives from an existing class (parent or superclass). The child class inherits all the attributes and methods of the parent class, allowing for code reuse and the creation of hierarchical class structures.

### Defining a Parent Class

A parent class can be defined using the `class` keyword:

```python
class Animal:
    def speak(self):
        return "Animal speaks"
git clone https://github.com/Sadam-Barkat/12-Inheritance.git
